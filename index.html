				<p>I am from San Rafael, California but I have lived in Spain and Hawai'i. I love my dogs, traveling and weird medical stuff. I recently got to spend a month traveling New Zealand with my boyfriend and it was hard to comeback. I had to though because I work at Starbucks and they are paying for my B.A. in Global Health.After graduation I was planning on graduate school for nursing but fell into coding instead. I have a new excitment for learning and six months is much shorter than three years. This is a completly different direction than I started with but I hope to gain the skills needed to become a hirable full stack web developer.</p>
